## by Ijaoba Abdulazeez


## Dataset
 > 
The exam dataset consist of information about 1000 rows of student and 8 features. The dataset was gotten on kaggle and created by aman chauhan. The dadset is clean and free from null values, Renaming the columns was necssary to make our analysis easier, extra two columns was generated to show the total marks of student and a categorical column to show if the students passed or failed. The object variables in the dataset were converted to categorical variables so as to make the exploration of the data easier.

## Summary of Findings
> Summarize all of your findings from your exploration here, whether you plan on bringing them into your explanatory presentation or not.

    * In the distribution of pass status,a bar chart helped show that majority of the students passed the exam.
    * The quantity of students in each category does not determine the number of those that passed and failed
    * There's a high positive correlation between all examscores and total scores. The histogram was the only logical plot to depict this.
    * female students performed well compared to the males in terms of total marks and pass status. 
    * students who completed their test prepartion course had high total marks even though the number of students that didnt complete the test were much.
    * more males completed the test compared to females but the females performed well than males 
    * more students who had standard lunch had high marks. this means that lunch had an impact on their performance
    * students whose parent have maters and bachelor degrees pefofrmed well than the rest
    * In terms of total marks and race, male and female from group E got high marks, and based on the median, in the group, the females surpassed the males.

> I decided to use total mark and pass status as a yardstick to determine their over all performance, and also, using the gender variable to categorize their performance. Then used the other variables such as the test preparation cource, ethnicity, parents education to see if they had any contribution to both genders performance. The key insight for the prepsentation are:

    * The distribution of the Total marks and pass status
    * The distriution of the gender : this will give us a picture of the number of males and females that took the exam
    * gender vs total mark: this will help reveal which gender passed or failed more
    * gender vs test_preparation_course: this relationship will give us an indept of whether it determined those that passed and those that didnt
    * race_ethnicity and total mark by gender:
    * parents_education and total mark by gender:
